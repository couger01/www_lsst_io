- title: "Data Management Applications Design"
  handle: "LDM-151"
  abstract_html: "<p>The LSST Science Requirements Document (the LSST SRD) specifies a set of data product guidelines, designed to support science goals envisioned to be enabled by the LSST observing program. Following these guidelines, the details of these data products have been described in the LSST Data Products Definition Document (DPDD), and captured in a formal flow-down from the SRD via the LSST System Requirements (LSR), Observatory System Specifications (OSS), to the Data Management System Requirements (DMSR). The LSST Data Management subsystemâ€™s responsibilities include the design, implementation, deployment and execution of software pipelines necessary to generate these data products. This document describes the design of the scientific aspects of those pipelines.</p>"

- title: "Data Management Middleware Design"
  handle: "LDM-152"
  abstract_html: "<p>The LSST middleware is designed to isolate scientific application pipelines and payloads, including the Alert Production, Data Release Production, Calibration Products Productions, and science user pipelines executed within the LSST Science Platform, from details of the underlying hardware and system software. It enables flexible reuse of the same code in multiple environments ranging from offline laptops to shared-memory multiprocessors to grid-accessed clusters, with a common I/O and logging model. It ensures that key scientific and deployment parameters controlling execution can be easily modified without changing code but also with full provenance to understand what environment and parameters were used to produce any dataset. It provides flexible, high-performance, low-overhead persistence and retrieval of datasets with data repositories and formats selected by external parameters rather than hard-coding. Middleware services enable efficient, managed replication of data over both wide area networks and local area networks.</p>"

- title: "Data Management Organization and Management"
  handle: "LDM-294"
  abstract_html: "<p>This management plan covers the organization and management of the Data Management (DM) subsystem during the development, construction, and commissioning of LSST. It sets out DM goals and lays out the management organization roles and responsibilities to achieve them. It provides a high level overview of DM architecture, products and processes. It provides a structured starting point for understanding DM and pointers to further documentation.</p>"

  abstract_html: "<p>This document describes the operational concepts for the emerging LSST Data Facility, which will operate the system that will be delivered by the LSST construction project. The services will be incrementally deployed and operated by the construction project as part of verification and validation activities within the construction project.</p>"
